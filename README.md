# pipefy-utils
A Pipefy utilities lib in Python for efficient GraphQL API queries and mutations.

After years of working with this incredible tool, I made this library to help others.
Note: Pipefy is a robust project management platform constantly developing, I'll do my best to keep this repository updated, but feel free to contribute.
